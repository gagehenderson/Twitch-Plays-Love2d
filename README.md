# Twitch-Plays-Love2d
Using twitch chat to play games, using LÃ–VE to easily display some info and stuff.

## Getting Started

1. Create your twitch app in the [twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).  
    - Should be a public app.  
    - Add a `http://localhost` redirect.
2. Get your oauth token.  
    - Can do this manually with this url:
    `https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize
    ?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    &redirect_uri=http://localhost
    &response_type=token
    &scope=chat:read+chat:edit`  
    - Then copy the token from the url.  
3. Create a `config.lua` file and define the following:
    ```lua
    return {
        oauth_token = "Your oauth token",
        channel = "The channel you want to join",
        username = "The username you want to use",
    }
    ```
